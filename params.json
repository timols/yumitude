Often, whilst attempting to install a particular tool, or project on another Linux OS (or Mac OSX via Homebrew or Fink or Macports etc), it can be mind numbingly painful. Lets fix that. Current package managers like Aptitude, Yum (RPM), Macports etc have different naming conventions for what are often common libraries.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n  * libcurl (Aptitude) <-> curl-devel (Yum)\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nIn order to find a package name, curl can be used:\r\n\r\n    # From a CentOS machine\r\n\r\n    $ curl yumitu.de/libcurl\r\n    curl-devel\r\n\r\nGenerally:\r\n\r\n    curl yumitu.de/PACKAGE_NAME\r\n\r\nYumitude relies on the User-Agent HTTP header to determine which way to translate. I.e. If you request the name of a Debian package from a RedHat linux distribution such as CentOS, you'll get back the appropriate RPM package name. So, if you want to get the package name translation of a different OS, you can adjust the User-Agent header:\r\n\r\n    curl -H \"User-Agent: <OS_NAME>\" yumitu.de/<PACKAGE_NAME>\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nIf you've found a mis-translated package, or if you'd like to extend what we currently have, simply update the relevant YAML file and issue a pull request.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, if you want to contribute, issue a pull request!\r\n\r\n## Licence\r\n\r\nYumitude is released under the [MIT License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/MIT):\r\n\r\n  * http://www.opensource.org/licenses/MIT"}
